 * @brief Check, and where possible repair, one data block against its suffix
 *
 * @param bytes  Data block followed by suffix, contiguous as transmitted
 * @param count  Data block plus suffix length, i.e. 28 for every packet that
 *               has a suffix at all
 * @param data   Receives the data block, corrected if it could be
 * @param data_length Data-block bytes, so the correction can be reported only
 *               when it landed in the block rather than in the suffix
 *
 * CEA-516 §3.4: the longitudinal byte is chosen so that the exclusive-or of the
 * data block and the suffix is 0xFF. The syndrome — that exclusive-or against
 * 0xFF — is therefore zero on a clean block, and on a block with one wrong bit
 * it has exactly that bit set. Which byte the bit is in comes from the per-byte
 * odd parity §3.3 requires: exactly one byte will have failed it.
 *
 * Two wrong bits in one byte leave the byte's parity intact and put two bits in
 * the syndrome; two in different bytes fail two parities. Neither is localised,
 * and both are reported rather than guessed at.
