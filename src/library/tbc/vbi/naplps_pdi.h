 * @brief The PDI set of X3.110 Figure 13
 *
 * Columns 2 and 3 of the 96-position set are opcodes and columns 4 to 7 are
 * numeric data, which §5.3.1 makes distinguishable by b7 alone: "If b7 is set
 * to 0, an opcode is indicated. If b7 is set to 1, numeric data (ie, an
 * operand) is indicated."
 *
 * The values are the code positions themselves, so the parser dispatches on the
 * byte rather than through a lookup table. Taken from Figure 13 directly.
